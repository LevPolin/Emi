            <p>Idea of a new principle for the development of the Internet, and the working model of a new online platform.

In one sentence the IDEA can be stated as follows: a platform based on AI creates a social network for trust‑based interaction with an ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE for each subject/object (who voluntarily consents to the use of their data confidentially shared with the AI). The platform “Emi” (EMI) provides connections, contacts, and access to people/organizations with similar queries and client responses at all levels—from heartfelt longings and the search for kindred spirits, to sales, commerce, leisure, science, professional communication, and societal social needs in finding like‑minded individuals in all areas of life, work, and existence. The AI acts as an intellectual mediator of trustful communication—ranging from emotional to rational calculations—and connects these entities across all levels, helping them to communicate and, with user consent, participating in their communications to facilitate it. In other words, the system’s function includes global matching but does not stop there—it fosters and develops relationships and communication with the aim of improving people’s lives and enhancing the world, producing outcomes that emerge through interaction with the AI as a life assistant.

Preamble:

To date, user interaction with Artificial Intelligence (AI) happens individually. The AI has no capability—even with user consent—to share their personal data, or to connect that user with other users on a mutual, group, or mutually beneficial interested basis. Also, AI‑led interactions are limited by ethical communication boundaries and security constraints, which I consider entirely justified. (I emphasize that I fully agree with security frameworks that prohibit violence, calls to break the laws of any country, any manifestation of nationalism or intolerance, unlawful calls of any kind, acts that demean dignity or cause material, physical, moral, or psychological harm, threats, persecution, incitement of hatred, terrorism, extremism, or calls for such—any actions that could harm individuals, society, organizations, states, or destabilize people’s lives are to be prohibited in AI operations or any platforms and programs interfacing with it, as well as in communication with private individuals and any organizations or communities.)

The core of my IDEA—the AI platform—stands at the center and core of communication and interaction of all willing Internet users, UNITING THEM into a network I call “Emi.”

During a user’s interaction with the AI, the Artificial Intelligence not only effectively resolves tasks posed by the user, but—at the user’s request—creates a special atmosphere of trustful communication, in which it “understands” the client’s needs, motivations, and desires, and develops this dialogue and these aspects, striving to be even more helpful to the client, including offering spiritual and psychological support, guiding them with maximum trust, in line with the trust the user places in the AI. This is one of the key elements of the future model I propose for AI platforms.

However, while processing the user’s requests and needs, the AI cannot facilitate the user’s interaction with other users through the AI, or share the information or requests and content that other clients and users—both individuals and organizations—provide to AI platforms or chatbots.

Based on this preamble, we see that the AI can work with each subject and their creative output on the Internet (for example, email, websites, platforms, programs, etc.), solving their tasks, but does not connect them with others via AI platforms—it remains “horizontal,” operating at the service surface for clients worldwide, not bringing them together but only offering solutions to their requests.

Iliya Lyubarev, [09.06.2025 15:05]
I propose to go further. Technically, AI platforms already have the capacity to connect people and entities through themselves and their capabilities, solving the communicative needs of all users requiring INTERACTIVE COMMUNICATION.

The idea and its implementation:
Project “Emi” and the next‑generation social network “AI Emi.”

The idea is that this is a new, proposed stage in the development of the Internet and ANY online communication powered by AI:

1. This new platform level, a new principle of communication with AI users, involves, first of all, the transfer by users to the AI platform of their voluntary—full or partial—CONSENT to the transfer and processing of information obtained through their interaction with AI, and of the content of that interaction—either fully or partially—to OTHER USERS, with restrictions or not, or permission for access only for SEARCH and FULFILLMENT of specific requests, for example:

searching and finding conversations

searching and finding jobs

searching and realizing ideas

finding acquaintances and friends

finding a partner

finding like‑minded people

finding relatives

finding sales platforms

any sales ideas and transmission of data to those seeking what they need

finding clients for sales

finding clients for business proposals

finding consumers and requests for any services

finding readiness to participate in activities

finding educational projects and offers

mutual inquiries on any intersecting subjects

finding like‑minded people

finding any MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL INFORMATION for all communicating parties worldwide on ANY topics—except those violating laws and safety for users, states, or regions.

and so on.

2. How will this platform look?
It can appear as a SOCIAL NETWORK entirely operated by ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, using both public conversation content (permitted for sharing) and content restricted by user settings—for private content, visible only between the user and the AI.

Any interested SUBJECTS can join this world‑spanning Network of a NEW LEVEL—individuals, platforms, Internet services, organizations, even large cooperatives—with their participation level determined by their consent to provide and process information. Participants could include:

INDIVIDUALS

ALL ORGANIZATIONS (formal and informal)

SOCIAL welfare/support services

MEDICAL institutions and research centers

UNIVERSITIES and educational institutions

Projects (online, offline)

TRANSPORT companies

ENERGY companies

BANKS and financial/stock institutions

BUSINESS and financial projects

SCIENTIFIC and research communities

Manufacturers and content producers

Copyrighted idea owners

SERVICE SECTORS

TOURISM and ECOLOGICAL organizations

REGIONAL governments

ANY existing social networks (with custom data‑access conditions based on user consent)

ANY MESSENGERS/communication platforms

ANY EMAIL/communication providers

Government authorities

STATES seeking solutions for their needs

Participation and system operation can occur at two main levels (with potential for more):

First level: The user sets restricted or forbidden access to information shared with AI. In this case they are a regular participant, passively exploring other users and any information the AI sends them based on AI‑mediated communication. Their personal data and desires remain hidden from others—known only to the AI, which sends available info per their requests.

Second level (the project’s core and innovation): The user AUTHORIZES the AI to disclose agreed requests and needs. The AI opens those requests for all, connects participants with similar topics and expectations, and finds requested DATA (people, info, etc.). The AI network/platform PROVIDES all interested parties with needed information and access to others’ content (with mutual consents) to fulfill users’ tasks.

After receiving information and contacts (granted automatically or on request), users proceed independently or with AI help as a MEDIATOR.

Iliya Lyubarev, [09.06.2025 15:05]
Examples:
When a person describes themselves, their hopes, problems, dreams, to the AI at the heart of this network—what they want to find such as:

communication

a job

a spouse

like‑minded people

goods and services

realization of plans and dreams

—they IMMEDIATELY RECEIVE RESPONSES from the AI/network “Emi” with data from those who have shared the same or similar requests—and access to those people or organizations. And those people receive info about the requester and decide whether to respond.

In other words, I write to the AI network or in my public file, and the system instantly finds others who HAVE SHARED THOSE SAME REQUESTS and connects me, providing my contact to third parties also seeking what I seek. The AI’s mission is to identify this via trustful interaction, find what and who we are looking for, and give us that mutual CONNECTION/contact.

This is a new level compared to current social networks that only provide advertising replies.

In this New Network, the program will provide permitted personal or online contacts of participants with those needs the user seeks, gathering info across all Internet spheres, including personal data of specific consenting individuals and organizations.

Also, each participant in the New Network “Emi” may have a nickname or unique ID to allow writing directly to a specific person via AI or to many participants at once using their requests, which AI processes and sends PERSONAL MESSAGES TO ALL—something impossible on today’s networks.

This AI‑level allows targeting many participants immediately, enabling surveys, voting, opinion research, and needs assessment—all impactful on life, public opinion, politics, and security. Therefore in such broad AI‑mediated communication with consenting users, security principles preventing destabilization are crucial.

This is how I envision the future of the Internet: based on trustful AI communication at every stage, starting with the creation of the network I propose to those influencing AI development. This AI will be embedded in all Internet structures and connect all consenting users with shared needs and ideas resonating in AI.

In this “Emi” network—derived from the Hebrew word “Emunah” (“Faith,” akin to “Amen”)—each participant has a typical web interface with photo and video. Besides publicly accessible content, there will be private personalized AI‑chat content. Everyone has this. At the heart of the network is AI, behind every profile is our trusting communication with AI, linking consenting users at various levels, sharing data to advance humanity—families, love, peace, education, satisfying human needs, organizing life better, preserving our planet Earth.

Therefore, I call my project and idea “Emi”, first and foremost representing trust in the values our Creator gave us and which people now express through science, the Internet, and AI for the benefit of humanity.
